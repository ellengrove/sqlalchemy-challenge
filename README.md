<br>
Analysis of temperature and precipitation measurements taken from 9 weather stations located on Hawaii over an approximately 7 year period. The SQLite database was comprised of a table recording each date that measurements were taken and the corresponding measurements and station they were taken at, as well as a table providing information about each station. 
<br>
<br>
Utilizing Flask, developed an API that takes routes specified by the user and returns temperature, precipitation, and station information, as well as average, minimum, and maximum temperature calculations over user-selected time periods. 
<br>  


## Technologies
<br>
Python, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Flask 
<br>
 

## Data Source
<br>
Database stored in `Resources/hawaii.sqlite`.  
<br>

## Additional Analysis and Observations
<br>
Charts plotted in Matplotlib detail the daily level of precipitation across all 9 stations in Hawaii over the last year of data (8/23/2016 - 8/23/2017). Rain was relatively evenly experienced throughout the year in Hawaii with the heaviest rain (in terms of inches of rainfall) in September 2016, February 2017 and April 2017.
<br>
<br>
A separate analysis of temperatures recorded in the last year of data at Hawaii's most active station demonstrated that the most regular temperatures recorded were between 73 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit.
